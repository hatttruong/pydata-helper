## Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line

Links: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

- Create a new repository on GitHub. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or `gitignore` files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.
- Open Git Bash.
- Change the current working directory to your local project.
- Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
```
$ git init
```
- Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
```
$ git add .
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use ' git rm --cached YOUR-FILE'.
```
- Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
```
$ git commit -m "First commit"
```
- At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.
- In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/abc/xyz.git
# Sets the new remote
$ git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL
```
- Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
```
$ git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
```

## Set up username and password

```
# install git (MAC)
$ git --version
# If you donâ€™t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

$ git config --global user.name "Ha Truong"
$ git config --global user.email "xxx@gmail.com"
```
